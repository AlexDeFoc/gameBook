# Wiki for any game I play

# Purpose
I dislike wikis for games because of too much cluttered content. I really like
the simplicity of a barebones site.

This site simulates the absence of any other wiki. Meaning all the data is from
my experience and these games. Probabilities, drops, items and all the data.

The reason it's not based on other wikis is to prevent spoilers. The data is
available on the site simply for fast and easy access to data. As it should be.
